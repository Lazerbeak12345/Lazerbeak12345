## How to use my dotfiles

I'm making use of an approach introduced to me by [kalkayan and their dotfiles](https://github.com/kalkayan/dotfiles).

```bash
git clone --bare https://github.com/Lazerbeak12345/Lazerbeak12345 $HOME/.dotfiles
```

There's a lot of reasons why this approach is awesome, and perhaps the biggest one is its simplicity.
