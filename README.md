## How to use my dotfiles

I'm making use of an approach introduced to me by [kalkayan and their dotfiles](https://github.com/kalkayan/dotfiles).

```bash
git clone --bare https://github.com/Lazerbeak12345/Lazerbeak12345 $HOME/.dotfiles

# then put this in your .bashrc

alias dotfiles="/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --work-tree=$HOME"

# refresh your bash instance, then use the dotfiles command to restore the .gitignore and any other files you'd like to try out.
# be sure to make backups!
```

There's a lot of reasons why this approach is awesome, and perhaps the biggest one is its simplicity.
